# Throff - Thai roff
This is my own implementation of roff/groff but with supports for Thai language. Mostly as to learn stuff related to typesettings.
Do not expect any compatibilities with existing mom documents due to how I am relying on a specific way of typesetting the document which required certain attributes.
